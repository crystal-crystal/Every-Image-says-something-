A Project On Image Steganography.
Steganography is the technique of hiding a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video.In this project we have implemented image steganography.

Advantages of Steganography over Cryptography

"The advantage of steganography over cryptography alone is that the intended secret message does not attract attention to itself as an object of scrutiny. Plainly visible encrypted messages, no matter how unbreakable they are, arouse interest and may in themselves be incriminating in countries in which encryption is illegal.
Whereas cryptography is the practice of protecting the contents of a message alone, steganography is concerned both with concealing the fact that a secret message is being sent and its contents".
